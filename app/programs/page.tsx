Analysts will work individually and in teams to explore industry trends, evaluate investment strategies, and analyze case studies that reflect real-world client scenarios. In Investment Management, they will study portfolio construction, asset allocation, and performance evaluation across different market environments. Within Private Banking, analysts will examine the role of relationship management, tailored financial solutions, and high-net-worth client services. On the Financial Planning side, they will research retirement planning, tax optimization, and wealth transfer strategies. By engaging with these interconnected areas, each analyst will not only sharpen their technical and analytical skills but also develop a holistic understanding of wealth management, ultimately contributing to the clubâ€™s collective output of research-driven insights."
